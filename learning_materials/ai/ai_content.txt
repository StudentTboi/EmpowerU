[What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?]

Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a field of computer science focussing on making machines smart. AI helps machines do things requiring human intelligence, like recognising language, decision making, and learning new things. 

AI is used in many areas. For example: 
- Self-driving cars: Cars capable of driving themselves
- Personalized healthcare: Doctors / healthcare words utilize AI to assist in diagnostic works and treatments. 
- Voice assistants: Virtual helpers like Siri or Alexa answer questions and perform tasks. 

[Why is AI important?]

1. Automate repetitive tasks: Capable of doing simple, repetitive tasks, freeing people for more things.
2. Improve decision-making: Use of data capable of helping people make better decisions.
3. Personalize experiences: Offering personalized recommendations, suggestion movies or songs you might like, this can already be seen in personalized adverts as well.
4. Help people with disabilities: Assisting in trouble in communication.

[Key concepts and terminology in AI]

- Machine Learning (ML): Type of AI where machines learn from data. Instead of being programmed with specific rules, machines learn from data, improvements in performance along the way. 
- Deep Learning: Different types of machine learning using neural networks that attempt to mimic how the human brain functions, recognizing patterns with provided data. 
- Natural language Processing (NLP): Part of AI that helps machines understand and process human language, such as speech and text. 
- Robotics: AI helps robots perform tasks, moving, picking up objects, and navigation.

[Types of AI]
 There are four main types of AI: 
1. Reactive Machines: These AI systems can only react to what's happening right now. No learning from past sequences.
2. Limited Memory: This type of AI can use past experiences to make better decisions in the future, like self-driving cars that learn from their surroundings. (Most typically depicted when commonly seen in AI media)
3. Theory of Mind: This is a future type of AI that might understand human emotions and interact with people in a more human-like way. 
4. Self-Aware AI: This doesn't exist yet, but it would be AI that knows it exists and can think and reason like a human.
