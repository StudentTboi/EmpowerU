[introduction]
Python is a popular programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It is used for:
- Web development (server-side)
- Software development
- Mathematics
- System scripting
It is also widely recognized due to the versatility and ease of use among many web applications, and machine learning (ai)

[why Python]
Python offers several advantages:
- Words with different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- Syntax that is similar to English, making it more intuitive
- Fewer lines of code compared to many other languages
- Supports / enables multiple coding concepts : procedural, object-oriented, and functional programing
- Python is interpreted meaning you can run code as early as it is written

[python syntax]
- Python was written to be readable, with coding syntax akin to english and mathematics.
- Instead of semicolons or parentheses, Python uses newlines to complete a command. (This will be explored in the coding examples.
- Indents are used to define loops, functions, and classes.

[Basic Python Installation]
 To check if Python is installed:
 - Windows: Search for "Python" in the start menu or run `python --version` in Command Prompt.
 - Linux/Mac: Open the terminal and type `python --version` to verify if Python is installed. 

If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official website: 

[https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/). 
[Running Python Code] After writing a Python file (e.g., `helloworld.py`), you can run it via the command line:

[code example]

print("Hello, World!")

expected output:

Hello, World!
